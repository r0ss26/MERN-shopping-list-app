Website: https://fast-sierra-99068.herokuapp.com/

A full-stack shopping list application that allows users to manage their items via a simple user interface created with React and Reactstrap. The back-end is implemented using an Express.js server and a MongoDB database. Custom middle-ware is used to authenticate users and restrict access for creating and deleting items.
